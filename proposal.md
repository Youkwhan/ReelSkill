# Capstone Proposals

## 1. Problem Statement
Studying for technical interviews or trying to stay on top of emerging technologies, such as those in software engineering, can be daunting and time-consuming. Aspiring candidates often struggle to effectively organize and prioritize their study materials, especially when it comes to practicing coding problems and reviewing key concepts.

Existing platforms and resources may offer a plethora of technical interview questions and practice problems, but they often lack features that facilitate efficient learning and retention, such as spaced repetition. Without a systematic approach to review and reinforce knowledge over time, candidates may find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information or forget critical concepts before the interview.

Therefore, there is a need for a software solution that addresses these pain points by offering a comprehensive platform for technical interview preparation with built-in spaced repetition functionality. This solution should provide users with curated lists of technical interview questions, interactive coding practice sessions, and personalized study plans based on spaced repetition algorithms. By leveraging spaced repetition techniques, the platform aims to enhance users' learning efficiency, improve long-term knowledge retention, and ultimately boost their confidence and performance in technical interviews.
